            At the Water Lantern Festival, sustainability is at the heart of
            everything we do. Guided by our “Leave No Trace” philosophy, we are
            committed to preserving every event location and giving back to the
            communities we visit.
            <br />
            <br />

            Our experienced event team leads a thorough clean-up operation after
            each festival. Every lantern is retrieved from the water, and we go
            a step further by collecting any trash already present in or around
            the venue — ensuring we leave the space better than we found it.

          We use eco-friendly materials in our lanterns, including biodegradable
          rice paper and wooden bases. LED candles are reused and recycled
          wherever possible, helping us minimize waste and reduce our overall
          environmental footprint.
          <br />
          <br />

          By making thoughtful choices and encouraging responsible practices, we
          aim to offer a magical, meaningful, and environmentally conscious
          experience for everyone.
